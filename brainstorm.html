  <h1 class="mb-4">Brainstorming Research Topics with AI</h1>

  <p>Not sure where to start? You’re not alone. Choosing a research topic is often the hardest part—and that’s where AI can help. Tools like <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, <strong>Claude</strong>, and <strong>Perplexity</strong> can help you explore ideas, expand your thinking, and narrow down a topic that’s just right for your assignment.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-4">🔎 What You Can Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Turn a broad idea (like “climate change”) into specific questions you could research.</li>
    <li>Discover different angles, subfields, or case studies within your topic.</li>
    <li>Find connections between your interests and academic disciplines.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-4">🧠 Try These AI Prompts</h2>
  <p>Open a chat with your preferred AI tool and try one of these:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>Suggest 5 possible research questions about climate justice in the U.S.</code></li>
    <li><code>What are some ethical dilemmas related to artificial intelligence in education?</code></li>
    <li><code>How could I explore the relationship between music and memory in a research paper?</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Don’t like the answers? Ask follow-up questions like <code>"Make these more focused"</code> or <code>"What would a psychology student focus on?"</code></p>

  <h2 class="mt-4">🎯 Narrowing Your Focus</h2>
  <p>AI can give you a starting point—but <strong>you decide where to go from there</strong>. Once you see some topic ideas, ask yourself:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which ones actually interest me?</li>
    <li>Can I find enough credible sources on this?</li>
    <li>Does this fit the assignment or course theme?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-4">📚 Connect to Library Resources</h2>
  <p>Once you have a working topic, it’s time to check whether there’s research on it. Use your library's databases to search articles and books. You can even ask AI:</p>
  <p><code>Help me turn this topic into search keywords for an academic database.</code></p>

  <h2 class="mt-4 text-danger">⚖️ Academic Integrity Reminder</h2>
  <p>AI can help you think, explore, and question—but it can’t do your thinking for you. Be sure your topic reflects <strong>your own understanding</strong> and is shaped by your own interests and goals. Don’t copy an AI-generated topic exactly without adapting or refining it.</p>
